These are instructions on setting up an environment to run CDS/RL simulations in the ipython notebook. 



```
conda create --name cdsrl
source activate cdsrl
```
Double check that you have python >=3.5
```
conda install tensorflow
conda install zlib
conda install mpi
conda install jupyter

python -m ipykernel install --user --name cdsrl --display-name "Python (cdsrl)"
```

Clone Stable-Baselines Github repo and replace the line gym[atari,classic_control]>=0.10.9 in setup.py by this one: gym[classic_control]>=0.10.9

Install Stable-Baselines from source, inside the folder

```
cd "stable-baselines directory" # change this to wherever you put the Stable-Baselines Github repo
pip install -e .
```

Similarly, clone the spinningup Github repo, and install Stable-Baselines from source

```
cd "spinningup directory" # change this to wherever you put the spinningup Github repo
pip install -e .
```

Now, you should be able to launch this notebook and set your kernel to cdsrl (or whatever you named your environment)
