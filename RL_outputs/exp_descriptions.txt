Spinup_tests:
Initial experiments to verify the functioning of spinup algorithms on standard openAI gym environments


Cdsalpha_tests:
Tests verifying the function of the custom gym environment CdsAlpha, as well as initial tests probing RL performance on CdsAlpha. Alpha is a parameter that renders the system uncontrollable at/near zero, but as it increases, renders the system more and more unstable. Various amounts of noise were tested along a sweep of the parameter alpha. 
In this version of the environment, experiments are run on randomized initial states, and the stopping condition is a function of the state (these two properties were changed in the next version). 


Finhoriz_tests:
In the finite horizon tests, the CdsAlpha environment was edited to run for a fixed number of steps per run in order to make comparisons with SysID/Optimal Control more natural. Also, for all experiments that have noise, the starting state is zero.


(Future: scalar_tests):
These tests will probe RL performance on a 1D-state system, where alpha only affects stability. This is meant to show how stability/instability affects performance in the absence of controlability issues.
